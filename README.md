## Inspiration
Why always visualise data with graphs when you can use music to feel the data!

## What it does
StockTunes gets the data of your favourite stock for the past 3 months and composes a good sounding tune out of it

## How we built it
We used HTML, python, ffmpeg and many other awesome technologies. The process is as follows
- Get the name of the stock and crawl the web to get the stock data
- Preprocess the crawled data
- Compose a tune with the data with notes
- Apply a sound font on the notes to get a tune and mix it up to make it sound pleasing
- Put it in the cloud so that it can be accessed from anywhere
- Use a website to play the music generated by your stocks and visualize them beautifully

## Challenges we ran into
Converting the data into sound is easy but converting the sound into music rather than noise was a really interesting challenge to work on

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We created some cool sounding tunes from the otherwise boring numeric stock data!

## What we learned
We learned so many new technologies for playing around with music files and what makes music sound so good

## What's next for StockTunes
Add lyrics to the songs with relevant data ;P
